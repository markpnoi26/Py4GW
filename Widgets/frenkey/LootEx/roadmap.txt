General Logic

Iterate over items and determine, depending on what map type we are on Outpost / Explorable
    - Identified or not?
    - Is the item an loot item we configured, e.g. OldSchool with perfect stats, low Req max damage weapons/shields, if so we stash it
    - Has Mods we want to keep/sell, if so extract them
    - If the item is a rune we want to sell, keep until we are at a rune merchant and sell it
    - If the item has a value above a threshold which changes depending on wheather or not you are in an outpost or explorable map, keep it until we are at a merchant and sell it
    - If the item can be salvaged, salvage the item for (rare) materials
    - If we can sell the item instead, sell it


Dictionary of itemids with one item action to do

________________________________________

What do we need?
    - List of Mods to pick those we want to keep
    - List of Dyes to pick those we want to keep
    - List of Runes to pick those we want to keep/sell

LootItem.py 
Setup specific items to keep
ModelId or Itemtype // need a way to handle without ModelId instead by itemtype so we can look for all low req scythes
DamageRange = [0, 100] --> low damage, max damage 
Requirement = [0, 1, ... 13] --> Collection of Requirements, empty = any
PrefixMod = modstruct --> empty = any
SuffixMod = modstruct --> empty = any
Inscription/Inherent Mod = modstruct --> empty = any
OldSchool = bool
Rarities = [Any, Common, Uncommon, Fine, Rare, Unique] --> Requires at least one rarity, else defaults to Any


Filter.py
Defining Filters to pickup by creating filters or handling common item groups. An Item has to match only one filter to be picked up
ItemTypes = [Weapon, Consumable, Armor ...] --> Empty = any
Rarity = [Any, Common, Uncommon, Fine, Rare, Unique] --> Requires at least one rarity, else defaults to Any


Profile
Dyes = [Grey, Blue ... White, Black] --> empty = any
PCons = [Cupcake, Candy Corn, ...] --> empty = any

ItemsByRarity = [Any, Common, Uncommon, Fine, Rare, Unique] --> Requires at least one rarity, else *NO ITEM* will be picked up unless handled in other filters and rules 

Filters = [] -- Collection of Filters
 
PriceCheck
Checks for items we want to keep based on their mods, skins ... 
These determine what we'll do with the items
HasNiceMod(LootItem) --> Checks if the item has a selected mod struct
HasNiceSkin(LootItem) --> Checks if we want to keep the skin
 
LootHandling
The logic for the Handling of the Loot, broken down to small steps and a Processing Function.
HasItemToSell() --> bool
HasRuneToSell() --> bool
HasScrollToSell() --> bool
HasDyeToSell() --> bool
HasMaterialToSell() --> bool
HasRareMaterialToSell() --> bool

HasItemToIdentify() --> bool
HasRuneToExtract() --> bool
HasModsToExtract() --> bool
HasItemToSalvage() --> bool

IdentifyItems() --> true while doing so
ExtractRunes() --> true while doing so
ExtractMods() --> true while doing so
SalvageItems() --> true while doing so
SellItems() --> true

NeedsIdentifyKit() --> bool
NeedsSalvageKit() --> bool

BuyIdentifyKit() --> bool
BuySalvageKit() --> bool
 
Loot FSME
An FSME API everyone can implement in their bots, this will expose only very few methods which are required 
InternalUse
IsMerchantNearby() --> bool, check for a nearby merchant
HasItemsToProcess() --> bool, checks if there are items we want to process


API
PickupLoot()  --> bool, while looting
HandleInventory()  --> bool, while items beeing salvaged etc, this should ideally be running while other things to save time

RequiresMerchant() --> int merchantActions, int itemsToSell, int itemsToBuy - returns the number of merchantActions (itemsToSell + itemsToBuy)
HandleMerchant() --> bool, while items beeing bought and sold

IsInventoryFull(itemid = -1) --> bool, check if the inventory is full for a given item id, e.g. just farming Cupcakes we can farm until the last slot is filled with a stack of 250 and not if the last slot is filled by a single one

AddItemTemporary(LootItem) --> Add a Loot Item which is used while your bot is running
AddFilterTemporary(Filter) --> Add a Loot Filter which is used while your bot is running
