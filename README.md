### Stop tracking log/configuration files

If you want want to stop tracking local changes to the log and configuration files used by Py4GW you can use the following commands to temporarly remove them from the worktree.

```bash
git update-index --skip-worktree Py4GW_injection_log.txt
git update-index --skip-worktree Py4GW.ini
git update-index --skip-worktree Py4GW_Launcher.ini
```

You can then verify that the files are correctly skipped by running this command that should output the list of skipped files: 

```bash
git ls-files -v | grep "^S"
S Py4GW.ini
S Py4GW_Launcher.ini
S Py4GW_injection_log.txt
```

To re-enable local tracking of the files run the following commands: 

```bash
git update-index --no-skip-worktree Py4GW_injection_log.txt
git update-index --no-skip-worktree Py4GW.ini
git update-index --no-skip-worktree Py4GW_Launcher.ini
```
